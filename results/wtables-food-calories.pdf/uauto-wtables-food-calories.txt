Food Calories List

From: www.weightlossforall.com

The food calories list is a table of everyday foods listing their calorie content per average portion. The food calories list also gives the calorie content in 100 grams so it can be compared with any other products not listed here. The table can be useful if you want to exchange a food with similar calorie content when following a weight loss low calorie program.

The food calories list is broken down into sections based on the 5 basic food groups of a balanced diet.
